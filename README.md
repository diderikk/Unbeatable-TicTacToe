# The Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe Application


<p>The program is implemented with the Minimax algorithm to compute and play possible best moves. Will later add Alpha-beta pruning for improved efficiency. The web-application is built with the react library. This is my first React-project, and therefore some of the code has taken inspiration from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React tutorial</a>.<br />
Currently, I have not distributed the web-application. Therefore, to run the application:</p>
<code>cd tic-tac-toe </code>
<br />
<code>npm install</code>
<br />
<code>npm start</code>
