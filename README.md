# The Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe Application


<p>The program is implemented with the Minimax algorithm to compute and play possible best moves. Will later add Alpha-beta pruning for improved efficiency. The web-application is built with the react library. This is my first React-project, and therefore some of the code has taken inspiration from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React tutorial</a>.<br />
The web-application has now been deployed to GitHub pages and can be found at:
